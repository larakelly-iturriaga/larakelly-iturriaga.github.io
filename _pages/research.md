My research focuses on **the role of language distance in bilingual language processing**. **Language distance** can be defined as the overlap between linguistic (e.g., lexical, phonetic, morphosyntactic, orthographic) features across languages.
Specifically, I look at whether **L1-L2 distance affects bilingual lexical access**. 

As part of my PhD research, I'm currently exploring bilinguals' L2 word recognition, more specifically, how bilinguals process **interlingual homographs**, i.e., words with identical spelling and different meanings across languages. For instance, how Turkish-English bilinguals process words like *bay*, gentleman in Turkish; or how Spanish-English bilinguals process *pie*, foot in Spanish.
To explore the role of L1-L2 distance in bilingual language processing, I'm comparing **bilingual speakers of close vs distant languages** from different linguistic contexts:
1. Study 1, comparing **Turkish-English** and **Spanish-English bilinguals** from *monolingual communities*
2. Study 2, comparing **Basque-Spanish** and **Catalan-Spanish bilinguals** from *bilingual communities*
3. Study 3, comparing L2 and L3 word recognition in **Azeri-Turkish-English trilinguals** from *monolingual communities*

My PhD supervisors are [Prof Mits Ota](http://www.lel.ed.ac.uk/~mits/) and [Prof Martin Pickering](https://edwebprofiles.ed.ac.uk/profile/martin-pickering).

For my MA thesis, I focused on how **L1-Turkish and L1-Spanish learners of English processed interlingual homographs** in an L2 lexical decision task. The task also included control words (matched in frequency and length) and English-like non-words. If you are interested in the stimuli used for this study, you can find them [here](https://osf.io/h6mcx).
