My research focuses on **the role of language distance in bilingual language processing**. **Language distance** can be defined as the overlap between linguistic (e.g., lexical, phonetic, morphosyntactic, orthographic) features across languages.
Specifically, I look at whether **L1-L2 distance affects bilingual lexical access**. 

As part of my PhD research, I'm currently exploring bilinguals' L2 word recognition, more specifically, how bilinguals process **interlingual homographs**, i.e., words with identical spelling and different meanings across languages. For instance, how Turkish-English bilinguals process words like *bay*, gentleman in Turkish; or how Spanish-English bilinguals process *pie*, foot in Spanish.
To explore the role of L1-L2 distance in bilingual language processing, I'm comparing **bilingual speakers of close vs distant languages** from different linguistic contexts:
1. Study 1, comparing **Turkish-English** and **Spanish-English bilinguals** from *monolingual communities*
2. Study 2, comparing **Basque-Spanish** and **Catalan-Spanish bilinguals** from *bilingual communities*
3. Study 3, comparing L2 and L3 word recognition in **Azeri-Turkish-English trilinguals** from *monolingual communities*

My PhD supervisors are [Prof Mits Ota](http://www.lel.ed.ac.uk/~mits/) and [Prof Martin Pickering](https://edwebprofiles.ed.ac.uk/profile/martin-pickering).

I recently created **LexTurk**, a short **Turkish vocabulary test** based on the [English LexTALE (Lemhöfer & Broersma, 2012)](https://www.lextale.com/whatislextale.html) with [Levent Uzun](https://avesis.uludag.edu.tr/ulevent/publications) and [Umut Salihoğlu](https://avesis.uludag.edu.tr/umutms/publications). I am currently collecting data from Azeri-Turkish-English trilinguals and L1-Turkish participants to assess LexTurk's validity.

Feel free to contact me with any questions about stimuli, instructions and additional materials, which can be made available upon request.

For my MA thesis, I focused on how **L1-Turkish and L1-Spanish learners of English processed interlingual homographs** in an L2 lexical decision task. The task also included control words (matched in frequency and length) and English-like non-words. If you are interested in the stimuli used for this study, you can find them [here](https://osf.io/h6mcx).
